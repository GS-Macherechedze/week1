* Define core database terminology.
* Explain the purpose and function of key database components.
* Understand the relationship between a database and a Database Management System (DBMS).
* Grasp the concept of normalization and its importance in database design.
* Design a basic database schema using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

## 2.  Section B: Discussions

2.1.2.    Explain the difference between a database management system (DBMS) and a database.

2.1.3.    Discuss in short, the importance of normalization in database design and provide an example of how it can improve data integrity.

## 3. Section C: Practicals

3.1.1. Design a database schema for a movie database. Include entities such as movie (movie ID, title, release year, director, genre), cast member (actor ID, name), and movie_cast (movie ID, actor ID) to establish the relationship between movies and actors. Represent this in a well-drawn diagram.
